# Data-Encryption-Standard-DES

**Introduction**

***This program implements the Data Encryption Standard (DES), a symmetric-key algorithm for the encryption of digital data. Although DES has been superseded by more advanced encryption techniques, studying and implementing DES provides valuable insights into cryptographic principles and encryption algorithms.***

*Features*

[] DES Encryption
[] DES Decryption
[] Hexadecimal output for encrypted data
[] Key generation from plaintext input
[] GUI for easier interaction (Future Work)
[] Advanced encryption mode implementations (e.g., CBC, CFB) (Future Work)

*How to Use*

To use this program, compile the source code with a C++ compiler supporting C++11 or later. The program will prompt the user for plaintext and a secret key (key), which the user will enter in this order. It will then be encrypted, and then decrypted.

More to come in the future...
