# Data-Encryption-Standard-DES

**Introduction**

***This program is intended to implement the Data Encryption Standard (DES), focusing on encrypting electronic data. The DES algorithm, while historically significant, is no longer considered secure for modern encryption needs. This implementation serves educational purposes and a base for understanding encryption principles.***



*Features*

[] DES Encryption: The framework is implemented, but due to compilation errors, it's not verified to work.
[] DES Decryption: Planned but not implemented.
[] Initial Permutation (IP): Although coded, correctness cannot be verified due to compilation errors.
[] Final Permutation (IP^-1): Coded but unverified due to lack of successful program execution.
[] Round Keys Generation: Implemented, but its integration and effect cannot be fully verified without running the program.
[] 16 Rounds of Feistel Function: Structured in code, but functionality is unverified due to compilation issues.
[] Hexadecimal Output: Intended but cannot be verified without successful compilation and execution.
[] Key Decryption: Not implemented.
[] Advanced Features: Future work might include implementing multiple modes of operation.



*How to Use*

Currently, the program cannot be compiled due to errors. Future versions aim to resolve these issues for a fully functional DES encryption tool. However, the requirements and process to run and use the program are below:

To use this program, compile the source code with a C++ compiler supporting C++11 or later. The program will prompt the user for plaintext and a secret key (key), which the user will enter in this order. It will then be encrypted, and then decrypted.



*Current Limitations*

• Compilation errors prevent the program from running, hindering the verification of implemented features.
• Several planned features, including decryption and advanced operational modes, are not yet implemented.



*Future Work*

• Addressing compilation errors for a successful build.
• Implementing decryption functionality.
• Expanding the program to support various encryption modes and enhancing security and usability.
